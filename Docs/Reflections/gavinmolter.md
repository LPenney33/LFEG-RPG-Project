### *Sprint 1*
	Began creating the UI for the game. Downloaded most of the assets regarding the UI but not much functionality.
### *Sprint 2*
	Created the UI for the game and added functionality to it.
### *Sprint 3*
	Completely had to delete the UI and start over. The UI was not working properly with the 2dCameras on the player scene.
### *Sprint 4*
	Completed all "easy" points like the reflections and the sprint logs.
### **Final Thoughts**
	This project was way too advanced for only being the first semester. We had not gone over how to code basic functions in godot. We had to learn a lot of things on our own. As for the group side of the project, the firing process was not feasible. As students, we shouldn't have to worry about firing a fellow peer. The firing process should be reserved for the "Manager" of the project. As the teacher of the class, you are the next highest athority in the class making you the manager. It should be your job observe the students and make sure they are doing their job. If they are not doing their job, you should be the one to fire them.
